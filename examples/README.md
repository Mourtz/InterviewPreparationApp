- "Describe a challenging technical problem you solved and your approach"
- "How would you design a scalable microservices architecture?"
- "What testing strategies do you use for full-stack applications?"
- "How do you ensure code quality in a team environment?"

## üìù Customization

Feel free to modify these files to:
